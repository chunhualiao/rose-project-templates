A sample project using automake, supporting --with-boost  and --with-rose to specify paths.

To build

1. prepare environment variables for boost and rose libraries.
  e.g:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/liao6/opt/boost_1.47.0/lib:
  source set.rose // after updating the path inside of it

2.

./build
./configure --with-boost=/home/liao6/opt/boost_1.47.0 --with-rose=/home/liao6/workspace/rose-2014-10-13/install
make
make check

3. to clean up everything
  ./cleanup.sh
