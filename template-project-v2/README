A sample project using automake, but does not support configure options to rose and boost library.

You must change both Makefile.am and set.rose to have correct paths to boost and ROSE:

e.g.:

ROSE_INSTALL=/home/liao6/workspace/rose-2014-10-13/install
BOOST_INSTALL=/home/liao6/opt/boost_1.47.0

After that, type:


Type

# to build configure
  ./build
# to build Makefile
  ./configure

# to make the binaries
  make

# to run the tests
  make check

# clean up all generated files
  ./cleanup.sh
