rose-project-templates
======================

rose-project-templates

A few templates for independent projects using ROSE.
By independent, we mean the projects are located outside of ROSE's source tree.

* template-project-v1 : using Makefile to build the project 
* template-project-v2 : using autotools to build the project, but requiring manual changes to paths.  
* template-project-v3 : using autotools, and support --with-boost and --with-rose options
