Simplest Makefile to build a project using an installed copy of ROSE

You must change Makefile's ROSE and BOOST installation path or export them as two environment variables with right paths. 

e.g.:
In Makefile: 

ROSE_INSTALL=/home/liao6/workspace/rose-2014-10-13/install
BOOST_INSTALL=/home/liao6/opt/boost_1.47.0

Or in bash
export ROSE_INSTALL=/home/liao6/workspace/rose-2014-10-13/install
export BOOST_INSTALL=/home/liao6/opt/boost_1.47.0

After that, type:

make 
make check
make clean


#-------------------- Another makefile sample, makefile2,  is also given
# it uses $(ROSE_INSTALLED)/bin/rose-config to automatically get all options.
# this one uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so you must modify and source set.rose to run the built translator
