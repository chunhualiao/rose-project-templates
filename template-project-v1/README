Simplest Makefile to build a project using an installed copy of ROSE

You must change both Makefile and set.rose to have correct paths to boost and ROSE:

e.g.:

ROSE_INSTALL=/home/liao6/workspace/rose-2014-10-13/install
BOOST_INSTALL=/home/liao6/opt/boost_1.47.0

After that, type:

make 
make check
make clean
